Problem 1
=========

Import the BRFSS data
---------------------

``` r
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'p8105.datasets' from a github remote, the SHA1 (21f5ad1c) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Clean the BRFSS data
--------------------

``` r
brfss_data = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")))
```

Pick out the states observed at 7 locations in 2002
---------------------------------------------------

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>%
  filter(n_location == 7)
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 2
    ##   locationabbr n_location
    ##   <chr>             <int>
    ## 1 CT                    7
    ## 2 FL                    7
    ## 3 NC                    7

In 2002, CT, FL and NC were observed at 7 locations.

Make a “spaghetti plot”
-----------------------

The code chunk below makes a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_location = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_location, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "The spaghetti plot")
```

![](p8105_hw3_yh3094_files/figure-markdown_github/spaghetti_plot-1.png)

From 2002 to 2010, the number of locations in most states was fewer than 10. In FL, the number of locations had the biggest change over time. Before 2007, the number of locations in FL was fewer than 10 each year, while in 2007, the number of locations in FL was up to 44. Then, the number of locations in FL decreased to fewer than 10 again. However, in 2010, the number of locations in FL increased to 41.

Make a table
------------

The code chunk below makes a table showing, for the years 2002, 2006, and 2010, the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  filter(
    locationabbr == "NY", year %in% c("2002", "2006", "2010"), response == "Excellent"
  ) %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_excellent = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sd_excellent = sd(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

|  year|  mean\_excellent|  sd\_excellent|
|-----:|----------------:|--------------:|
|  2002|             24.0|            4.5|
|  2006|             22.5|            4.0|
|  2010|             22.7|            3.6|

The mean of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State decreased in 2006 and then increased a little bit in 2010. The standard deviation of the proportion of “Excellent” responses across locations in NY State showed a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2010.

Compute the average proportion in each response category for each year and state
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>% 
  summarize(mean_response_proportion = round(mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,215 x 4
    ## # Groups:   year, locationabbr [?]
    ##     year locationabbr response  mean_response_proportion
    ##    <int> <chr>        <fct>                        <dbl>
    ##  1  2002 AK           Excellent                     27.9
    ##  2  2002 AK           Very good                     33.7
    ##  3  2002 AK           Good                          23.8
    ##  4  2002 AK           Fair                           8.6
    ##  5  2002 AK           Poor                           5.9
    ##  6  2002 AL           Excellent                     18.5
    ##  7  2002 AL           Very good                     30.9
    ##  8  2002 AL           Good                          32.7
    ##  9  2002 AL           Fair                          12.1
    ## 10  2002 AL           Poor                           5.9
    ## # ... with 2,205 more rows

Make a five-panel plot
----------------------

The code chunk below makes a five-panel plot that shows, for each response category separately, the distribution of these state-level averages over time.

``` r
brfss_data %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>% 
  summarize(mean_response_proportion = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = mean_response_proportion)) +
  facet_grid(~response) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = factor(year))) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = median, geom = "point") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "State-level averages", title = "The five-panel plot")
```

![](p8105_hw3_yh3094_files/figure-markdown_github/five_panel_plot-1.png)

The state-level average proportion of “Very good” responses remained highest compared with that of other response categories over time. And the state-level average proportion of “Poor” responses remained lowest over time. For all response categories, these state-level averages didn't change much over time.

Write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of observations.

The Instacart data has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Variables for `aisle`, `department`, `eval_set` and `product_name` are class `character` and other variables are class `integer`. The dataset contains products of 39,123 different names bought from 134 different aisles within 21 departments. 0.6 of all items ordered have been ordered by the user in the past. Among those items which have been ordered before, Banana is the most popular. Most orders were placed at 14 ± 4.2 hours of the day.

The first observation is Bulgarian Yogurt (product id: 49302) bought from the yogurt aisle (aisle id: 120) of the dairy eggs department (department id: 16) by the user whose id is 112108. The order (order id: 1) was placed at 10 on Thursday. The order sequence number for this user is 4. This product was the first product added to cart by this user and has been ordered before. 9 days has past since the last order placed by this user. The evaluation set this order belongs in is train.

The ninth observation is Grated Pecorino Romano Cheese (product id: 39612) bought from the specialty cheeses aisle (aisle id: 2) of the dairy eggs department (department id: 16) by the user whose id is 79431. The order (order id: 36) was placed at 18 on Saturday. The order sequence number for this user is 23. This product was the first product added to cart by this user and hasn't been ordered before. 30 days has past since the last order placed by this user. The evaluation set this order belongs in is train.

Calculate the number of aisles and find out the most frequent
-------------------------------------------------------------

``` r
n_distinct(instacart$aisle) ## number of aisles
```

    ## [1] 134

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  top_n(1)
```

    ## Selecting by n

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   aisle                 n
    ##   <chr>             <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables 150609

There are 134 aisles. Fresh vegetables is the aisle which the most items ordered from.

Make a plot
-----------

The code chunk below makes a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle. Order aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(aisle, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 8)) +
  labs(x = "Aisle", y = "Number of items", 
       title = "The number of items ordered in each aisle")
```

![](p8105_hw3_yh3094_files/figure-markdown_github/aisle_plot-1.png)

The number of items ordered in most aisles are below 25,000, although in some aisles, like "fresh fruits" and "fresh vegetables", the number of items ordered are quite large, more than 150,000.

Make a table
------------

The code chunk below makes a table showing the most popular item aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  top_n(1) %>% 
  rename("the most popular item" = "product_name") %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  knitr::kable() 
```

    ## Selecting by n

| aisle                      | the most popular item                         |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          |

The most popular items aisle “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits” are Light Brown Sugar, Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats and Organic Baby Spinach, respectively.

Make a table
------------

The code chunk below makes a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  ## Convert order_dow from numeric to character
  mutate(
    order_dow = recode(order_dow, "0" = "Sunday", "1" = "Monday", "2" = "Tuesday", "3" = "Wednesday", "4" = "Thursday", "5" = "Friday", "6" = "Saturday")
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    order_dow = factor(order_dow, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
  ) %>% 
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_time = mean(order_hour_of_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_time) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

| product\_name    |  Sunday|  Monday|  Tuesday|  Wednesday|  Thursday|  Friday|  Saturday|
|:-----------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream |    13.8|    14.3|     15.4|       15.3|      15.2|    12.3|      13.8|
| Pink Lady Apples |    13.4|    11.4|     11.7|       14.2|      11.6|    12.8|      11.9|

On most days of a week, the mean hour at which Pink Lady Apples is ordered is earlier than that and at which Coffee Ice Cream is ordered.

  nrow()
```

Write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which missing data is an issue.

The NY NOAA data has 2595176 observations and 7 variables. Variables for `id`, `tmax` and `tmin` are class `character`. Variables for `prcp`, `snow` and `snwd` are class `integer`. Variable for `date` is class `Date`. The medians of precipitation, snowfall and snow depth during the study period are all 0. The data was collected from 747 unique weather stations.

There are 72278 obseravtions containing no information about temperature, precipitation, snowfall or snow depth, which is about 0.03 of all observaions. The proportion of missing data of `tmax` is 0.44. The proportion of missing data of `tmin` is 0.44. The proportion of missing data of `prcp` is 0.06. The proportion of missing data of `snow` is 0.15. The proportion of missing data of `snwd` is 0.23. In my opinion, if more than 1/5 of data are missiong, it would become an issue. And whether missing data is an issue also depends on whether the data is randomly missing or non-randomly.

Clean the NY NOAA data
----------------------

``` r
ny_noaa = ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(col = date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-")
ny_noaa$tmax = as.numeric(ny_noaa$tmax)
ny_noaa$tmin = as.numeric(ny_noaa$tmin)

0 is the most commonly observed value for snowfall. Because for most of the time between 1981-01-01 and 2010-12-31, it didn't snow in NY state.

Make a two-panel plot
---------------------

The code chunk below makes a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years.

``` r
ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(month %in% c("01", "07")) %>% 
  group_by(month, year, id) %>%
  summarize(tmax_mean = mean(tmax, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = tmax_mean)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(~month) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "The average max temperature", 
       title = "The average max temperature in January and in July in each station across years")
```

The average max temperature in January and in July fluctuated a lot across years. In January, except in 1981, 1985, 1989, 1997 and 2006, all other years had outliers. In July, except in 1992, 1997, 1999, 2009 and 2010, all other years had outliers.

Make a two-panel plot
---------------------

The code chunk below makes a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 separately by year

``` r
tmax_tmin = ny_noaa %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin)) +
  geom_hex() +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

snowfall = ny_noaa %>% 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = snow)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

tmax_tmin + snowfall
```

Tmin had the positive relationship with tmax. And The distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less than 100 remained almost the same across years.
